Learning Rust
This repository is dedicated to learning and understanding the Rust programming language. Rust is a multi-paradigm system programming language focused on safety, especially safe concurrency. It is syntactically similar to C++, but its designers intend it to provide better memory safety while maintaining high performance.

What's Inside?
This repository will contain various examples, exercises, and projects that will help in understanding the different concepts of Rust. From basic syntax to advanced concepts like concurrency, this repository will serve as a comprehensive guide for anyone who wants to learn Rust.

Getting Started
To get started with Rust, you need to install it on your system. You can do this by following the instructions on the official Rust website: https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install
